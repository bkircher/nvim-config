# nvim

Neovim configuration.

If you (s)tumble over this: Don't do this. It downloads mostly unaudited code from the Internet to your $HOME directory and executes it as your current user. No sandboxes. What a terrible idea this all is.

Aaanyway, if you wonder where you can learn about all this, there is a video series on YouTube,  [Neovim from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ), that nicely explains a lot of what is going on here. Original source from which this here is taken, mostly: [LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch/).
