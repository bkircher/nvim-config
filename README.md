# nvim-config

A very minimal Neovim configuration I use for work. It does not use any plugin
managers and does not randomly execute untrusted code from the internet.

Anyway, if you wonder where you can learn about all this, there plenty of videos
and channels on YouTube.

Clone this repository like

    git clone git@github.com:bkircher/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim

## TODO

- [ ] Make spelling work with my dictionary somehow
